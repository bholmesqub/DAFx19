# Measurements of the Big Muff Pi tonestack

## Comparison between linear and logarithmic pots

The below video illustrates the change in amplitude response to a change in potentiometer rotation. On the left are the measurements from the tone stack with a linear potentiometer, and on the right those from the tone stack with a logarithmic potentiometer.

At the extreme ends of rotation the difference is negligible. The most notable difference is in the middle of the range where the linear potentiometer transitions more smoothly than that of the logarithmic potentiometer, which changes the most over the last 90 degrees of rotation.

The potentiometer was placed in the circuit such that when rotating it clockwise the bass would increase, and treble for counter-clockwise. This is counterintuitive so was flipper for the above video, but makes no difference to the results of the paper.
