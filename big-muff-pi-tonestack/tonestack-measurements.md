# Measurements of the Big Muff Pi tonestack

The device measured wasn't taken from a Big Muff Pi, but was built on a breadboard from a schematic.

## Comparison between linear and logarithmic pots

The below video illustrates the change in amplitude response to a change in potentiometer rotation. On the left are the measurements from the tone stack with a linear potentiometer, and on the right those from the tone stack with a logarithmic potentiometer.

At the extreme ends of rotation the difference is negligible. The most notable difference is in the middle of the range where the linear potentiometer transitions more smoothly than that of the logarithmic potentiometer, which changes the most over the last 90 degrees of rotation.
