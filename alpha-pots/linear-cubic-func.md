# Linear-cubic Piecewise Function

![](../images/linear-cubic-piecewise-function.png)

Below is the MATLAB code required to generate the linear-cubic piecewise functions used in fitting to the Alpha potentiometer characteristics. An example of how to use the function [can be found in this gist](https://gist.github.com/bholmesqub/8ec9b0ce237896bdbfaf17ce22f41f96), which was used to make the above plot.
